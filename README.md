ML Classify Customers Segments
Created as part of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree.
The project uses Python version 2.6

In this project I classified the whole sale company customers using a soft cluster non supervise model. By only using the customer purchase behavior the model I built was capable of identify different types of customers.

The project includes a jupyter notebook, the used dataset and html version of the notebook and code to visualize the results.
